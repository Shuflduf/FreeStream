# Known problems
- The site was made on a laptop, for a small small screen, and only tested on my laptop and my phone. Objects may appear to be oddly scaled due to the screen size
- Sometimes the content on a page doesn't automatically refresh, so a manual reload is occasionally necessary when something isn't working correctly
- The search bar MIGHT overlap with the home button
- Switching seasons would cause the background to jump
